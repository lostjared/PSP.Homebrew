This one wasnt easy to write since every time I needed to test it
i Had to boot up GTA. So I wrote a library to allow me to write code on windows
on than compile it out for PSP..

To compile ( if you have PSPSDK & SDL installed )

make

after compilation it 
will attempt to copy to your PSP if its drive letter is N and its in usb mode

to compile for PC:

make pc

well if you like this please tell me..


special thanks goes to Fanjita for his Tetris and Eboot loader..

this is based off his gtadev kit
