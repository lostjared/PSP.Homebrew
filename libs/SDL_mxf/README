Purpose:
	Library for rendering small font files in a simple way that can be created with a editor
	also contains Pixel access level functions that may come in handy for other operations.




How to build:

	make -f Makefile.gen
	./configure

	make

	sudo make install


	optional step to help with compiler errors

	cp /usr/local/include/SDL_mxf.h /usr/local/include/SDL



/----------------------- old readme kept intact --------------------------/


SDL_mxf version 1.20
this file originated on masterx-ovdm.info

 
To compile for current platform

./configure

To compile using mingw32 (on Debian)

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/i586-mingw32 --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc

for PSP

 LDFLAGS="-L$(psp-config --pspsdk-path)/lib -lc -lpspuser" \
     ./configure --host=psp --prefix=$(psp-config --psp-prefix)

Note: if you dont have pspsdk in your path than issue the following command

export PATH="/usr/local/pspdev/bin:$PATH"


The api of this lib is a little messy, since it was written almost a year ago
but it still works. The purpose of this library is to allow you to use windows 
fonts in your SDL applications without having to compile freetype and SDL_ttf
Its a very small compact library and is easy to use.
